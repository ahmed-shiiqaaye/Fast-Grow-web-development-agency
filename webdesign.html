                <h2>AN ONLINE BUSINESS CARD</h2>
                <p>We do Web Design in Cape Town.  Websites are often referred to as “digital business cards”.  However there is much more to what a good site can do you for you nowadays. You can have a lot of information about your business on your site. Visitors can get an idea of who you are and what you do.  It gives them the opportunity to get in touch before making a call which can really help with your admin.  If your website looks appealing, works well and is professional, you are more likely to receive more enquiries.  Why? This communicates the level of service you are offering to the potential customer.</p><br>

                <h2>WEBSITES FOR ONLINE GROWTH </h2>
                <p>Having a website is a great way to help grow your business. With a website you will have more opportunities to reach people and increase your potential leads.</p><br>
                <p>Your competitors have a website, you should have one too. If your industry is very competitive, having a website provides an opportunity for you to keep up with the competition. You don't want to get left behind!</p><br>
                <p><span>89% </span>of website users will turn to your competitors if they have had a poor user experience. For that reason, you will need a website to be designed with user experience in mind. Don't worry, we've got you covered.</p><br>

                <h1>WHAT IS WEB DESIGN AND WEB DEVELOPMENT?</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="inner">
                <p>Web design in Cape Town focuses on the “look and feel” of the website. This includes colour schemes, fonts, layout, amongst other aspects.</p><br>
                <p>To put it simply, web developers use code to give websites the ability to function, while bringing them to life in the process. Therefore, web design and web development work together in order to create a beautiful, fully functional website</p><br>
                <p>We use Wordpress to build all of our websites. Why? We get the best digital marketing resutls with them.  Here is also an article which explains why we love Wordpress.</p><br>
                <h2>what is the difference between a web designer and a graphic desinger</h2>
                <p>As mentioned above, web designers focus on the aesthetics of the website. Graphic designers on the other hand, create visual elements such as logos, business cards, invitations, flyers, etc. Therefore, graphic designers create design elements that can be used on a website whereas web designers focus on the design of the site itself.</p><br>
                <h2>WHAT IS MOBILE WEB DESIGN?</h2>
                <p><span>74%</span> of all website visitors are more likely to visit a website if it is mobile-friendly.</p><br>
                <p>Mobile web design ensures that your website can be viewed properly on a mobile device. Websites are designed using a desktop and because mobile devices have much smaller screens, sections of your website may appear jumbled, or may not appear on a mobile device at all.</p><br>
                <p>Instead of using the term “mobile web design” web designers call this “responsiveness”. This means that your website is “responsive”, it can be viewed properly on desktop, mobile and tablet. More and more people are using their mobile devices when conducting searches, which is why responsiveness is crucial for your website.</p><br>
                <h2>WHY HIRE A WEB DESIGNER?</h2>
